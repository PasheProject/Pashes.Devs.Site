Tonight Pashe Architect Microsoft MVP [Ashraf Alam Bhai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashrafalam/) 
presented how to stay connected & get the update. This is really a challenge as Pashe engineers are working from 6 different countries. Now it seems everyone easily can get the update from a single point of source. Pashe blogging going to be another knowledge sharing platform.
