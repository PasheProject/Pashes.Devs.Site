Few discussion points and decision:
1.	We will launch static pages for now to keep the donation platform running/live. 
	This would help us learning field operation challenges.
2. 	We will complete our ground tasks asap to make Pashe opensource.
4.	Enlisting Pashe as non-profit organization.
3.	Had some discussion  on Pashe running budget arrangement/management. 
Team is very excited! Stay tuned :)
